This repository contains Bash scripts designed to initialize projects with a single command. Each script automates:

- Creating project directories.
- Setting up Python virtual environments.
- Installing required dependencies.
- Generating starter files.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/single_shot_code.git
   cd single_shot_code
   ```

## Run a setup script:
- The project will be initialized in the current working directory.
   ```bash
   ./setup_<project_name>.sh
   ```

## Activate the virtual environment:

   ```bash
   source <project_folder>/venv/bin/activate
   ```

## run the main project file

   ```bash
   Python <main_project_file>
   ```

# Example: Click Flick
The setup_click_flick.sh script initializes a project called Click Flick, a tool for controlling the mouse cursor with hotkeys.

Features:
Move the cursor to the center of monitors using Ctrl+Alt+<number>.
Move the cursor to specific regions using Ctrl+Alt+W/E/R/S/D/F/X/C/V.
Run the script, activate the virtual environment, and execute the Python file to start using Click Flick.
